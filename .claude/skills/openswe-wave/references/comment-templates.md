## Dispatch

```markdown
@openswe repo <owner/repo> — Execute <TICKET> only.

Enter plan mode first. Re-anchor all cited paths and symbols against `<ref>`, state any refuted premise as a Challenge, and do not implement until approval is posted in this Linear thread.

Required scope: <scope>.
Boundaries: <non-goals>.
Verification: <focused tests>, `make lint`, and `make typecheck`.
PR body: include the Linear reference and `Closes <TICKET>` as a standalone line. Let normal Open SWE Review and required CI run; do not directly merge or bypass gates.
```

## Approval

```markdown
@openswe Plan approved. Proceed with <TICKET> implementation only.

Challenge adjudication:
- <ratified/refused challenge and evidence>

Clarifications:
- <binding implementation clarification>

Run <focused tests>, `make lint`, and `make typecheck`. Open the normal PR with the Linear reference and standalone `Closes <TICKET>`. Let Open SWE Review and required CI run; do not directly merge or bypass gates.
```
