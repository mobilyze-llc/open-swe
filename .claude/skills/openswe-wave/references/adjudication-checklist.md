# Wave adjudication checklist

## Before dispatch

- Pin the current target ref and run `scripts/anchor-sweep` over the canonical ticket text.
- Open every cited path and symbol; moved anchors require semantic re-verification.
- Verify live-state claims with read-only GitHub, Linear, or LangGraph queries.
- Separate deployed/runtime claims that cannot be checked into Unverified claims.
- Reconcile predecessor tickets and recently merged work before preserving old scope.
- Confirm the requested mechanism is not already owned by product code or an existing operator tool.

## Plan review

- Challenges quote exact contradicting evidence, state what would disprove it, and correct scope visibly.
- Questions capture operator intent rather than silently deciding it.
- Unverified claims are honest external dependencies, not narrated successful checks.
- Every acceptance criterion maps to a deliverable and a focused verification step.
- New state, config, dependencies, or subsystems name the simpler rejected alternative.
- Failure behavior is fail-closed where mutation, merge, credentials, or incomplete evidence is involved.
- Product and operator boundaries remain explicit.
- The PR title/body, release note, test plan, closing line, and Linear reference follow repository conventions.

## Spot-audit

- Compare the diff to the approved plan, including refused scope.
- Inspect actor/identity evidence, stale-head protection, and mutation command order.
- Confirm quiet-path behavior does not wake on baselines, acknowledgements, progress, or queue movement.
- Confirm every approved wake node is reachable and no extra node is emitted.
- Confirm required checks and review gates cannot be bypassed.
- Confirm fixtures distinguish observed facts from inferred transient fields.
- Run the focused tests independently and inspect representative CLI output.
